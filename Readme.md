# Nextjs Task Manager

## Overview
This project is a simple task management application built with Nextsjs and Reactjs. 
It allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, as well as filter tasks based on their status.

## Key Features
- Task addition, edition, and deletion.
- Task filtering by status (all, complete, incomplete).
- Responsive design for all devices.

## Technical Details
- **State Management:** Utilizes React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for local state management.
- **Styling:** Uses CSS modules for component-specific styling.
- **Architecture:** Implements a simple component structure, separating presentation components from stateful logic.

## Common Bugs Introduced (for Learning Purposes)
- State-related issues due to incorrect state handling.
- Infinite loops caused by misuse of `useEffect` dependency arrays.
- Props drilling problems, leading to complicated data flow.
- Key prop issues in list rendering, causing inefficient DOM updates.

## Tools for Debugging
- **Browser Developer Tools:** Essential for inspecting HTML elements, CSS styles, and JavaScript code.
- **React Developer Tools:** A browser extension for debugging React component trees, including props, state, and hooks.
